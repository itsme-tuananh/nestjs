<p>The @types/googlemaps library that is installed in the next video has been deprecated. Instead, we need to install a different library:</p><p><code>npm install @types/google.maps</code></p><p>Also, you will still see a TS error in your code editor:</p><p><em>Cannot find name 'google'.ts(2304)</em></p><p>As the very first line in the index.ts file, you will need to add a triple slash directive:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">/// &lt;reference types="@types/google.maps" /&gt;</pre><p>You can read about this in the official docs here:</p><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/using-typescript#Module_Import" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/using-typescript#Module_Import</a></p>
